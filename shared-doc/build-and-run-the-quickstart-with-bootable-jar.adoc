= Building and running the quickstart application in a bootable JAR

You can use the WildFly JAR Maven plug-in to build a {productName} bootable JAR to run this quickstart.

The quickstart `pom.xml` file contains a Maven profile named *bootable-jar* which configures the bootable JAR building:

                      </executions>
                  </plugin>
                  ...

          </build>
      </profile>
----
The plugin uses https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-glow[WildFly Glow] to discover the feature packs and layers required to run the application, and provisions a server containing those layers.

If you get an error or the server is missing some functionality which cannot be auto-discovered, you can download the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-glow/releases/tag[WildFly Glow CLI] and run the following command to see more information about what add-ons are available:

.Procedure

. Build the quickstart bootable JAR with the following command:
+
[source,subs="attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package -Pbootable-jar
----

. Run the quickstart application contained in the bootable JAR:
+
[source,subs="attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
ifdef::uses-jaeger[]
$ JAEGER_REPORTER_LOG_SPANS=true JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE=const JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM=1 java -jar target/{artifactId}-bootable.jar
endif::uses-jaeger[]
ifndef::uses-jaeger[]
$ java -jar target/{artifactId}-bootable.jar
endif::uses-jaeger[]
----

. You can now interact with the quickstart application.

[NOTE]
====
After the quickstart application is deployed, the bootable JAR includes the application in the root context. Therefore, any URLs related to the application should not have the `/{artifactId}` path segment after `HOST:PORT`.
